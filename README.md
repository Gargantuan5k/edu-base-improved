# eduBase Improved
## eduBase, Done Even Better
---
This project is a continuation of ![eduBase - Classroom Management](https://github.com/Gargantuan5k/edu-base).
I created this new repository because I wanted the original eduBase project to still remain. The original repo will be archived sometime in 2024.

I plan to rewrite the entire code base since the source code for eduBase became really convoluted and hard to maintain.

I'm not 100% sure what I'll be doing with this improved version, but I do have some idead, including a proper GUI and better UX, maybe some CV  application inside.

I will be working on this project whenever I get some time, which won't be very often (at least until late May/early June 2024).

Cheers, Sid
